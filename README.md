# raft

A buggy implementation of the [raft paper](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf)/ [consensus algorithm](https://raft.github.io).

This is by no means production ready and there is little aspiration to get there. If you search for a working solution, go look at a proper implementation like [go.etcd.io/etcd/raft](https://pkg.go.dev/go.etcd.io/etcd/raft) or [github.com/hashicorp/raft](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/raft) instead.
